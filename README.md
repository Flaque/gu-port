## Before you get going
Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed. If you've never used yarn before, it's basically a replacement/wrapper for npm that has less build problems, is faster, and overall has a nicer experience. 

## To Run

``` 
yarn run dev
```

Then open `localhost:3000` in a browser.
